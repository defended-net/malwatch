# Security Policy

Security is considered of greater importance than any other aspect of our software. Any reported vulnerability,
regardless of severity is escalated to immediate priority.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please send the report to `security@defended.net`

We kindly request that you please **do not create a GitHub Issue** to report a security vulnerability. This policy
is out of respect for users of the affected version.

While not required, a Proof of Concept or other instructions which detail how to reproduce would be immensely appreciated.

You can expect a response within 24 hours. Feedback for security ideas or features is welcome.

Full recognition will be given should the report be valid.
