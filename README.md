![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/defended-net/malwatch) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/defended-net/malwatch)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/defended-net/malwatch)

Malwatch is a fast and lightweight malware scanner written in `go` for Linux based web server environments. It is capable of scaling to any requirements and is in production with some of the internet's largest deployments.

Besides excellent detection rates, key design considerations are low resource usage while delivering leading performance. A powerful and easy to understand API is provided to cover your alerting requirements and platform integration.

Real time monitoring is offered by `malwatch-monitor`. The number of files present on the system or volume being created / changed does not influence startup time, memory or cpu usage because a queue design ensures there would always be the same resource usage as an equivalent ondemand file scan. The result is an extremely efficient monitoring presence which would otherwise be impractical due to resource usage.

A complete malware signature set is included with seamless updates provided by our [signature repo](https://github.com/defended-net/malwatch-signatures).

There is tremendous value if malwatch is elected to replace your fleet's existing commercial solution. Please consider sponsoring to help us maintain this and other projects.

# Primary Features

- On Demand and Real Time scans.
- Leading performance with resource usage profile delivered in ~22 MiB memory alongside low cpu footprint even under full load.
- Comprehensive malware signature set.
- Submit feature to upload new malware samples.
- Simple yet powerful API to integrate with your backend and platform. Ideal to improve threat intelligence.
- Flexible alerting capability with built-in support for PagerDuty, e - mail and custom JSON. Use the API to easily add your own!
- Complete control over the outcome of malware with the help of `actions`. We include `alert`, `quarantine`, `clean` and `exile` but custom ones can be defined.
- Intuitive and completely transparent signature management. Commit changes to a `git` repo for secure delivery.
- Structured logs entirely formatted as JSON.
- ACID compliant database for record keeping.

# Getting Started

Create a directory anywhere you prefer, software is meant to be portable. A common choice is `/opt/malwatch`. Then extract the binary there from the downloaded archive:

    wget https://github.com/defended-net/malwatch/releases/download/v1.3.0/malwatch_1.3.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    mkdir /opt/malwatch
    tar -C /opt/malwatch -xzvf malwatch_1.3.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz

It would be recommended to integrate it with your `PATH`:

    ln -s /opt/malwatch/malwatch /usr/local/bin/malwatch
    ln -s /opt/malwatch/malwatch-monitor /usr/local/bin/malwatch-monitor

Config files will automatically be built in the binary's path upon execution. Let's try:

    malwatch

If you are using automation (such as Ansible) and want a clean exit, then `malwatch install` can be used.

Optional config files have the `.disabled` file extension. These can be renamed to `.toml` to enable.

# Configuration

Some basic config variables are needed for operation and are defined in the file `cfg/cfg.toml`. We should start with `targets`. The term `target` means a group of paths which share a common parent. This is accomplished using regex. 

The use of `(?P<target>.*)` is a **capture group**. Any paths under the directory `/var/www` will be considered the `target`. The default `Paths` config variable is `/var/www/html`, which means any detections will be associated as target `html`.

Once configured, you are ready to perform your first scan!

    malwatch scan /var/www/html

## Scheduling Scans

`cron` can be used to schedule scans at preferred intervals. It is not recommended to use scheduled scans if real time scanning with `malwatch-monitor` is already being used.

The command `crontab -e` is used to add or modify cron jobs. The command field can specify the absolute path `/opt/malwatch/malwatch scan` to automatically scan all targets. An example configuration to update signatures at midnight followed by a scan at the following hour is as follows:

    0 0 * * * /opt/malwatch/malwatch signatures update
    0 1 * * * /opt/malwatch/malwatch scan

## Real Time Scanning

Real time malware scanning is possible with `malwatch-monitor`. A `systemd` unit can automatically be created with `malwatch install systemd`. This is optional - feel free to set up your own or use any preferred method such as a foreground process or even `screen`. We believe software should be flexible.

Using `systemd`, it is necessary to `enable` followed by `start`:

    systemctl enable malwatch-monitor
    systemctl start malwatch-monitor

# Submit Malware Samples

Our API can receive malware samples to improve the signature base. One upload is permitted per week and additional uploads are included for our [Sponsors](https://defended.net/sponsor)

# Platform Integrations

Malwatch can operate as standalone or easily be compatible with any setup.

- cPanel

cPanel is included as a drop - in platform integration. It can be enabled by renaming the file `cfg/platform/cpanel.disabled` to `cfg/platform/cpanel.toml`. No further configuration is needed for it to work.
